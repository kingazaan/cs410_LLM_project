# CS 410 LLM Project
This is the repository of our CS 410 LLM project. This project transforms the transcripts of Fall 2023 CS 410 online lectures into a dataset and preprocesses it before using it to train a LLM model that can take a CS 410 - related question input and generate answers.

# CS 410 Lecture ChatBot Tool
This README is the software documentation for this project.

## Dataset
The `data` folder stores the crude data gleaned from the video transcripts of the CS 410 lectures. `all_lectures.csv` aligns each piece of transcript text with the week number, lesson number and lesson title as introduced in the Fall 2023 offering of CS 410 @ UIUC. These data are to be preprocessed by the LLM model. The `sample_data` folder contains some variants of a segment of our data that can be used for demoing or testing.

## Model
The model implementation and testing lies in the `scripts` folder.
- `testing_llm.ipynb` contains the implementation of the LLM GPT model. It includes code to preprocess the dataset (e.g. word tokenization), the setup of our GPT-based (using `nn` model to decode from massive pre-learned embeddings to pruduce answers to user input) LLM model (with multiple variants, including scaled dot-product attention and multi-head attention), and a `Flask` frontend for users. 
- `testing_QA_finetuning.ipynb` attempts to fine-tune a snapshot of a trained model by creating a QA model (unsuccessful).
- `testing_bigram.ipynb` makes a bigram model (instead of the unigram models in `testing_llm.ipynb`) to parse pairs of consecutive words in the cleaned dataset (used as a test engine).
- `model-0*.pkl` are all the trained model files, saved to a pkl, trained from running the GPT model on the all_lectures.csv dataset. The best iteration at the moment is `model-06.pkl`

# Overview of the Function of the code
This Python Flask app uses our GPT model made from scratch, in the `testing_llm.ipynb` file. This file attempts to create the GPT structure, and utilzing lecture data it runs through the GPT model, and trains on parameters we had chosen for minimal loss. This results in the `model-06.pkl` output, which is then used by the flask frontend. The user inputs a prompt into the frontend, and the text generation takes over and produces an output predicting some of the next words/answers to the prompt. This was trained with a relatively low amount of GPU, and was not pretrained, so outputs are not as strong as for example OpenAI's ChatGPT, yet these outputs are still promising and provide good oversights into lecture data for this class.

# Implementation of Software
This app is generally implemented in the following manner:
Step 1: Mount Google Drive

Step 2: Install Required Packages
Installs the necessary Python packages (torch, transformers) using pip.

Step 3: Load Dataset
Loads a dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.

Step 4: Data Cleaning
Various data cleaning steps using NLTK and regular expressions

Step 5: Tokenization and Filtering
Tokenizes and filters the cleaned transcripts.

Step 6: Embeddings and Vocabulary
Creates word embeddings and builds vocabulary

Step 7: Implement loss function, parts of the block (tranformer class) such as Head, MultiHeadAttention, FeedForward, and finally the GPTLanguageModel Module class which actually embeds the input, passes it through the transformer blocks, and finally generates words as an otuput from the prompt. Configures and sets up the GPT-2 language model. More about this is explained in video here: [Please find video presentation here]()

Step 8: Training
Defines Trainer and trains the GPT-2 model

Step 9: Model Evaluation
trainer.evaluate()

Step 10: Save Model

Step 11: Token Generation
Generates tokens using the trained model

Step 12: Flask Frontend
Creates a Flask web application for user interaction

## Evaluation
After releasing this LLM model, we would like to glean feedback from actual users to evaluate the effectiveness of the answers generated by our LLM. We trained a CNN model (in the `CNN` folder) to perform sentiment analysis. Since we don't have actual comments from users yet, we used movie reviews to benchmark the CNN model temporarily.

## Future Works
Future works include, training this dataset after breaking it up into finer segments and running it on a pretrained model in order to fine-tune it. This would probably give us better accuacies than what we currently have, simply becasue of the stronger computing power and larger word corpus to choose from.
