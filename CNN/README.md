# Benchmarking the performance of our LLM - CNN Model for Binary/Ternary-Based Sentiment Analysis
In practice, it is valuable to evaluate the quality of the response generated by our LLM. Simply asking users to "rate from 1 to 10" can be biased because different users have different grading scales. Instead, we'll ask for the user's response, and this model can automatically decide if a user likes our response. We here propose a CNN model to learn from large datasets (like movie reviews) and predict sentence analysis.

## Usage

- Split the training data (`IMDB Dataset.csv`, for example):
```
python3 overview_and_split_data
```
- Train the Model:
```
python3 main.py -dataset="IMDB"
```
- Using the Snapshots of our trained model to predict users' attitude of our LLM's response:
```
python3 main.py -predict="This LLM is very effective. I love it."  -snapshot="./snapshot/2023-11-19_22-21-09/best_steps_900.pt" 
```
